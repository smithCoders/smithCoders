### Hi there, I'm Esmael Abdulkadr! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate full-stack developer based in Ethiopia. With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I love crafting innovative and user-friendly web applications. 

ðŸš€ My tech stack includes JavaScript, Node.js, React, and MongoDB. I'm constantly exploring new technologies and methodologies to build scalable and robust software solutions.

When I'm not coding, you can find me enjoying a good cup of coffee â˜• and exploring the beautiful landscapes of Ethiopia.

Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects!
